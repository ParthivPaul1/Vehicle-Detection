This project strictly focuses on performance evaluation of different versions of Yolo models(v5,v6,v7,v8,v9,v10,v11,v12) on a prepared vehicle detection dataset(IRUVD Dataset) on seven colorspaces(RGB, BGR, HLS, HSV,LAB, YCrCb, XYZ). The key feature of this repositary is that it comprises of several Jupyter Notebooks run on Kaggle environment for different versions of Yolo Models in different colorspaces and from the results we analysed comprehensive metrics, i.e. Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Accuracy of the models on the dataset. Here are some pictoral glimpses of the results:
